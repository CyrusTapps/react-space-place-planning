## Team Responsibilities

### Claude (Technical Focus)

- Code structure and implementation
- Dependencies and library management
- Performance optimization
- Component architecture
- Technical documentation

### Gemini (Creative Focus)

- Visual storytelling
- UI/UX design direction
- Content creation
- Interactive element design

- Visual learning aids
- Interactive experiments
- Real-world connections
- Gamification elements

### Gamification System

#### Mission-Based Progress

- Topic-specific missions
- Achievement badges
- Unlockable special content
  - 3D models
  - Space soundscapes
  - Expert Q&A access

### Interactive Elements

#### Spacecraft Simulator

- Realistic component library
- Customization system
  - Colors and patterns
  - Mission patch designer
  - Testing environment

#### Space Fact Cards

## Styling Analysis

### Selected Approach: Tailwind CSS

#### Benefits

- Highly customizable
- Smaller bundle size
- Custom, unique designs
- Excellent responsive design
- Works well with animation libraries
- Better performance than alternatives

#### Additional Libraries

- @heroicons/react (space-themed icons)
- framer-motion (smooth animations)
- react-spring (physics-based animations)
- headlessui (accessible UI components)

### Color Palette

#### Primary Colors

- Navy Blue: #001F3F (RGB: 0, 31, 63)
- Nebula Purple: #9370DB (RGB: 147, 112, 219)
- Cosmic Teal: #00ADB5 (RGB: 0, 173, 181)
- Starlight Yellow: #FFD700 (RGB: 255, 215, 0)

#### Accent Colors

- Lunar Gray: #D3D3D3 (RGB: 211, 211, 211)
- Solar Orange: #FFA500 (RGB: 255, 165, 0)
